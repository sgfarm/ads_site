Today we're going to talk about the house of prayer, and then I'm going to give us some simple, powerful, reproducible tools, and we're going to practice them together. It's going to be really fun. I wrote some of the main scriptures we're going to be talking about, and so I'm going to read this one off here, and I'm going to read one more in a second as well. So it says, "And the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord, to minister to Him, to love the name of the Lord, and to be His servants. Everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it and holds fast my covenant, these I will bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar, for my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations or peoples." And then in the New Testament, you see Jesus actually quote this scripture.

What I think is really interesting is some of us, we've talked about how in Switzerland there's such a busyness that everyone wants to be busy, I want my schedule full, all these different things. And the thing that Jesus is flipping over in the table is literally the buying and selling of things. He comes into a temple that's distracted by busyness. and he flips the tables of it, and he declares that my house will be a house of prayer for all nations. And in other scriptures, in the Gospels, it says they were reminded that the Bible says zeal for his house will consume him. He'll get consumed with zeal that everything would be removed but him and his people being able to connect with one another.

And so, the first thing I want to talk about is, what is prayer? Because you hear that word a lot, and it's really simple. Prayer is relating to God. That simple. Prayer is relating to God. And most of us, when we heard the gospel, what probably appealed to you was that Jesus wanted to have relationship with you, right? So, if you buy into a gospel that's, I want relationship with God, but I don't pray, that doesn't really make sense with what you signed up for. Like, you bought into the gospel because you want a relationship, and then, but you're not actually enjoying that relationship.

And, so I also, I just want to say a few things that the church is not. The church is not a house of teaching and preaching. That is not what it is first. I'm just going to tell you all the things that it is not first. It is not first a house of preaching and teaching. It's not first a house of planning. It's not first a house of strategy. It's not first a building. It's not first a house of busyness or business. It's not a house of man. It's not a house of money. It's not a house of production. And it's not a house of music. Jesus said His house would be a house of prayer for all nations. And so Jesus' priority in His church is that He is getting the relationship with His people that He died for. That that's the first thing He's after.

And so another thing we see here is, okay, so me and God, like, that's relating to God. Us and God, that's, what kind of prayer is that? We call that corporate prayer sometimes. And that defined would just be us relating to God together. And then when you read Isaiah 56, it says a house of prayer. So what's a house of prayer? It would be a family relating to God together. And then it says a house of prayer for all nations. And that would be a missional family relating to God together. And so God's called us to be a missional family relating to God together in the house of prayer.

And something that God is changing, I believe, in the church is where prayer comes last in our hearts. Sometimes it's almost like we pray if we have time, but everything else is first. Like, well, if I do that, and then this, and then that, and then I have time, I'll pray. But it should be the opposite. It should be, I pray first, and everything else flows underneath that. And so we don't pray if we have time. And prayer is not optional. It's a required part of the gospel. And it's the first thing we do before we do anything. And it's the relationship that the gospel invited us into. Does that make sense?

So first, I want to talk about personal prayer. So, I'd love for everybody to flip to Matthew 6, verses 5 through 6. Matthew 6 verses 5 through 6. Matthew 6 verses 5 through 6. So this says, And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received the reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is not seen and unseen. Then your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. And then if you go down to verse 33, I want to read this as well. Matthew 6, verse 33 says, It says, but seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Or all these things will be added to you.

And so for us, it's important that we all have a place behind closed doors where it's just you and Jesus. And the reason why is because that's really the main place of identity for all of us. And I would say it's meant to be the most powerful place in your life. Like, is my expectation from my most powerful moments with Jesus a conference? A church building? A big gathering? Or is my highest place of expectation actually just me and Jesus behind closed doors? Like, what if that was where your greatest expectation to encounter God was? Because it says, your Father who sees in secret. So it's like God, our Father, when you get by yourself, just you and Jesus, where no one else knows and sees, it's like He puts His glasses on. He looks a little closer at you. Because He says, the Father who sees in secret. It's not a partiality thing. He just kind of leans in a little bit when it's just you and Him. Because if it's just you and Him behind closed doors, it's really hard for it to be about you. There's no one else there to watch you. Like, why would you do that if you didn't really love God? You know?

And then it also says, the other scripture, "...seek Him and His righteousness first, and all these things will be added." And I've learned our worry about tomorrow steals most of our days. If you don't seek Him and His righteousness first. But if you seek Him and His righteousness first, you're able to actually endure the day without giving yourself to worry and giving yourself to anxiety and letting the devil steal your day. But if I'm constantly worrying about tomorrow, The biggest issue is I probably don't have quality time with God in the morning.

And I say quality time with Jesus. Because you don't just want to check a box every morning. Is your time with Him quality? Like, do you like spending time with Jesus in the morning? Like, do you look forward to waking up in the morning to seek Jesus? And when you establish that as the most powerful place in your life, it is like... undefeated. Like, how can you not win with Jesus? Because if He's the first thing you look to in the morning, like, that changes your whole day every day. And it keeps you from worrying all the time. And there's different things that you could wake up thinking. Like, we all know it. We wake up with the most random things on our mind sometimes. You're like, why am I thinking about this thing in three weeks when I wake up? Or why am I thinking about these five tasks at work when I wake up? But if we seek God and His righteousness first, we can turn our eyes away from worry and on to Jesus.

okay and this is a place that like like we've talked about we're a community of accountable unity not loose networks and so this is where we actually need accountability like i want to be asked hey man how is like spending time with jesus in the morning been and i might ask you like hey did you get to spend time with him this morning not as a condemnation shame thing, but because I care about your spiritual health and you seeking Him first, I'm going to always ask people about that. And this is the place that we want to be discipling people. Because sometimes, you can meet people sometimes that have been a Christian for two years, but they don't spend time with Jesus in the morning. They go from one event, to the next event, to the next event, to the next event, but no one has sat down with them and actually been like, this is how you do this in the morning.

Like when I start discipling somebody in Waco, the first thing I do, a lot of times it's college students, is I tell them, I'm going to be at your house at 6 a.m. tomorrow, and we're going to spend time with Jesus. And I'll do that sometimes two or three weeks in a row with them, where I'll be like, hey, I'm going to wake up and spend time with Jesus with you, because I want you to learn how to learn from Him. And if I come and I model that, and I just help get you started, He'll teach you from there. But most people, they get told to spend time with God, But they have no idea how to spend time with God. It's like, hey, make sure you get up in the morning. Okay, I'll do that. But then they get there and they're like, what do I do here? What do I do when I get up? You know? And so, like, I want us to be a people that, like, when you start investing in somebody, the first thing you do is, okay, how can I get them connected to Jesus behind closed doors? Learning from Jesus themselves. Because the Bible says, from the least to the greatest, they'll all know me. And so they have something to learn from Jesus. And we can help model that a few times to help get them started.

Okay. So, next thing is I want to talk about ministry to the Lord. So if you read down here, Acts 13. Sorry, some of y'all can't see all of it. It says, Now in the church that was at Antioch, there were certain prophets and teachers. The dots aren't mentioned a bunch of names. As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Now separate to me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. Then, having fasted and prayed and laid hands on them, they sent them away. So, when you hear ministry to the Lord, I think most of the time when we think ministry, we think about one another, right? Which is good. We're called to minister to one another. But in Scripture, the word ministry is actually about 70% of the times you read ministry in Scripture, it's about to the Lord. It's actually vertical. And so this is kind of like a concept sometimes that I feel like is coming back more and people are learning.

But to be a minister to the Lord, it's like being a waiter or like a waitress at a restaurant. Like, for Jesus. Like, God, what do you want? When do you want it? How do you want it? Do you like this? Do you like that? Do you want this? And this is like the heart posture God wants to give us when it comes to worship and prayer. There's a lot of times prayer, like it can become about me or how skilled I am or my good words or my good voice or all these things. But worship and prayer is about touching God even more than it's about God touching me. Like, there's worship times where I don't feel anything, but I love this phrase I heard one time. It says, I might not feel God, but when I worship Him, He's going to feel me. And so when we worship and pray, whether I feel something or not, I want Him to feel me today. I want Him to feel loved. I want Him to feel blessed. Then it's not about feeling, it's about God.

I'm like, I want to feel it. I do. We all do, right? We love when we feel God. And that's not wrong, but at the end of the day, worship is about touching God's heart, blessing God's heart. I want Him to feel loved. So even when, say, I want to pick songs to sing today, I actually think less about what do people want to hear today. I think, what songs does God want to hear today? I wonder what song would bless His heart today, you know? that's what i'm thinking about and then also we're worship leading even or helping facilitate prayer and worship it's like obviously like we want people to be touched blessed we're not against that but at the end of the day we're actually we're not worshiping or even leading worship for them we're leading we're worshiping for him And so ministry of the Lord is also this way of thinking that God takes you out of an approval of man mindset about prayer and worship and into a waiter or waitress mindset with God. Like God, what do you want me to say to you today? What do you want me to sing to you today? What would make you feel loved in this moment? And this is mind blowing.

Like God, he feels something about how you live your life. It's unavoidable. How you live causes him to feel loved, pleased, grieved. Everything you do on your daily basis, he is emotionally connected to your life. So it's also this fear of the Lord thing where it's like, wow, like sometimes we live like assuming on his kindness and his mercy and his forbearance and patience. not knowing you living that way, you know it actually affects him. Like he actually feels something about that. Like he feels dishonored, or grieved, or these things. And again, when we're talking about the emotions of God, we're not saying at all that God's weak. The thing is, He can bear those emotions because His love is so strong. But for every person on earth, He actually feels something about your life and everything you do on a daily basis.

So it would be like, for example, me and Yonathan are friends. if I just kind of decided like, I'm just going to slap him in the face every day and act like that he doesn't feel anything. You, I mean, you can live that way with God, but like, how would you feel if I just kind of like slapped you in the face every day? probably not great yeah right exactly right and so like in a similar way like when I live my life thinking that like God's just kind of up there doing his thing and I'm gonna do my thing I have no idea actually the grief I could be causing him on a daily basis because of those decisions And so we make everything about God with ministry of the Lord. It's all about touching Him. It's all about blessing Him. It's all about Him feeling loved, whether I feel it or not. And that's what He's called us to do in the place of worship and prayer. And that's what the house of prayer is about. It's about touching God and ministering to Him. And so that's kind of a little bit on ministry of the Lord.

And if you want to do more study, we don't have time for it tonight, but you can go all throughout the Old Testament and the Levites in Scripture, and you can literally study their lives and watch. Like David set up these singers and musicians, and he called them ministers to the Lord, and he told them to minister to him day and night. So he literally set up this system of prayer and worship constantly just to bless God all the time. That God would always have a song being sang to him. Always have prayers being prayed to him throughout the day. And then I also want to show, you see it in here as well, you see, to minister to him. So Isaiah 56 says, So it's not just here, it's also in this passage that the house of prayer is called to minister to him and to love the name of the Lord and to be his servants. Okay, and the next thing, I'm going to just do a broad becoming a prayer and missions movement or a missional family relating to God together.

So in scripture, I'm going to mention a few, but you see this like kind of cycle throughout scripture where people repent, They pray, there's an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and then there's missions. They repent, they pray, there's an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and then there's missions. So, for example, in Acts 1.14, the disciples have all repented now for their unbelief about Jesus' resurrection, and they decide, okay, we should pray. And then what happens after Acts 1, 14? You go to Acts 2, Pentecost, outpouring. And then what happens? Mission, 3,000 get saved in a moment. And then you have Acts 2, 42 through 47, where they say they devoted themselves to prayer, to the breaking of bread, to the scriptures. And then after those people all repented at Pentecost, that's what they did. And then what happens? The Lord added to their number daily who were being saved. And then you have Acts 4, and they had some people go to prison, and they're afraid, they're discouraged, and from that place, they cry out to God, God, give us boldness, we're weak, we need your Spirit. And again, the place where they're shaken, gets shaken, they're filled with the Holy Spirit, what happens? Mission again, they start to share the gospel boldly. And then again, you go to Acts 8, you have the Gentile outpouring. You have these people, they repent and turn to Jesus, literally in the middle of Peter preaching. The Holy Spirit pours out on them, and then they start to share the gospel. And then you have Paul and Silas in prison in Acts 16, and they're preaching to prisoners. And they're praying and worshipping in this prison. And then the prison starts to shake. All the prisoners get let loose. But then from there, you actually see the gospel start to spread to Macedonia and all these other places. And so there's this continual cycle of repentance, prayer, outpouring of the Spirit, and then missions. Repentance, prayer, outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and then missions. And this happens over and over and over again.

And I've loved how in our community, the two things I feel like I've noticed since being here that we're falling in love with is prayer and repentance. We're like, okay, we need to pray more, and man, I need to repent like every day. Wow. You know? And that's what we're growing in. It's like, okay, I want to grow in prayer. And repentance just means to change your mind, right? And then the change of mind changes your life. And so we fall in love with prayer and repentance in this place. And it's what positions us for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit. And that outpouring of the Holy Spirit is what happens in Acts 13. They set apart people for the work that God has for them. Okay? Okay? All right. So next thing. So how many of us were at house church when I talked on Matthew 6, the top two verses of this? John, you were there. Well, not that part, the Our Father in Heaven part. You were there. You were there, yeah, yeah. You and John were there. I don't know if Jonathan was there. That was like when I came the first time before I came back. Yeah, that was the day we were at Peter's house. I made dinner. It was the first house church he was here. Pizza, maybe? No, different time. Yes, it was Janella's birthday. Okay, so anyways...

So I'm going to briefly go through this a little bit here, and then I'm going to connect some of the tools to this prayer. And again, this is like an endlessly discoverable thing, along with the rest of scriptures. If you think you know scripture, you're deceived, because you can endlessly know God in every verse in the Bible. It's an endless, like His glory never ends. So just our Father, you could discover the glory of our Father forever and never reach the end of it. So I'm just sharing that to show you. I'm going to show you kind of a way of prayer and some ways I feel like we can connect these three sections of prayer to some tools I'm going to give. So first, our Father in Heaven. Jesus' first thing He wanted to do to teach you prayer was say, we now have the same Dad. That's awesome. He's a genius. You know why? Because you don't know who you are without a dad. And Jesus knew, I need to connect them to my Father so that they can know who they are.

And then, in heaven. Have you ever read Revelation 4 before? Pretty crazy passage, Revelation 4. Well, that's your dad now. the one who's like Carnelian and Jasper, that's the one Jesus is now sharing with you as you come into Christ. Now, Jesus' dad is your dad, and he wants you to take your seat in the heavenly places with Christ, like Ephesians 2 says. Ephesians 2 is our position in Christ, which is to be seated with him in the heavenly places, beholding our Father in heaven. And then it says, hallowed be your name. So from that place of seeing the heavenly places of Christ, beholding the Father, you get used to, not in a way where you get bored, but you learn what heaven's culture is like up there. And as you get secure, as identity gets established, as you learn to worship in prayer, what happens is, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. So from that place of beholding Jesus, and seeing His beauty, and discovering His glory, and getting more accustomed to heaven's culture, then you start ruling and reigning in intercession. Let your kingdom come, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

So you start being taught by Jesus, who you're seated with, in front of the Father, how to rule and reign with Him. And then from there, give us this day our daily bread. We need to spend time with Jesus every day. You look at Exodus, when they're in the wilderness, God provided manna every day. And He said, don't save this for tomorrow. Believe I'm generous enough to give you manna every single day, if you'll position yourself to receive it. And then, remember last week, on Wednesday, I think it was, forgive us our trespasses, as we also have forgiven our debtors, and lead us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil. So we talked about deliverance last week. And we talked about forgiving. Sometimes unforgiveness is why there's a stronghold there, right? And so, what's great is... I need to find that marker. Oh, here it is. Okay. That's what I'm going to do. So... I gave you all a sheet. It says TWI on it, right? I'm going to talk about it in a second. In German, it's like D... What is it? What's the German? Wait, Jonah, what are the first... TWI is not TWI. It's D, the first letter of... D-A-F for German. Okay. I'm going to put that here. You're good. Or D-A-F. Okay. And then this, I'm putting that as Matthew 6. I'm going to abbreviate it. Matthew 6. And then right here was deliverance. And I'll put inner healing. Okay.

So these are the practical things that we're all learning that kind of encompass a good chunk of what prayer is, right? So I'm going to teach y'all some TWI in a second. I mentioned this Matthew 6 stuff about what does it mean to have a devotional life where every day I realize I need daily bread every day. And then lastly, we talked about deliverance, inner healing, and those places of, okay, we need to forgive, we need to repent, we need to command these spirits to leave, if we have open doors to them. And this is a lot of what prayer is. Okay? Now, I want to talk about TWI. Okay? So everybody put this sheet in front of you, in whatever language it is. I have a lot of fun with this one, so I'm excited for this. Okay. So, TWI.

So again, remember, Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. So Thanksgiving and worship are the Our Father, or in heaven, hallowed be Your name. And then intercession is the Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. So that's why I'm connecting those to the right. Okay? So, I'm going to talk just a little bit about Thanksgiving worship intercession, and then we're actually going to practice this together and have some fun with it, okay? So, Thanksgiving. So, the Bible says that to enter His courts with thanksgiving and His gates with praise, okay? The Bible also, so I think of like Thanksgiving, it's like your heart is like a closed gate until your position in gratefulness. And so when we thank Jesus, it's like opening the gates of your heart, right? Or other scriptures say magnify the Lord with Thanksgiving. Anyone know what a magnifying glass is? That's that thing you can see closer if you look through it. So I like to call Thanksgiving the weapon of the magnifying glass. You take that, and when you thank God, you apply it to the eyes of your heart. And what happens is you can focus in on Jesus when you thank Him. It gives you focus on Him to thank Him, magnify the Lord with thanksgiving.

I also think about Scripture says to give Him an offering of praise or an offering of thanks. And what happens when you put an offering on an altar? fire falls right okay and so it also says in first peter we give him spiritual sacrifices okay and so thanksgiving is like that it's like the opening of the gates of the heart or putting your glasses or a magnifying glass to the eyes of your heart or it's like laying an offering down for jesus because he's worthy i think about even in the book of romans it says that those who didn't believe they wouldn't acknowledge him as god or give him thanks That was the main things that God said kept them in unbelief. They wouldn't acknowledge Him as God, and they didn't thank Him as God. Okay? So it's also like thanksgiving, it like, it tills the unbelief out of your heart. It tills the staleness out of your heart. It makes you aware of God. Okay?

So, on this page, This way of prayer, you start with thanksgiving. You can thank Him for anything and everything. My friends and I, we always say you can thank Him for anything from a hot shower to the cross. can thank him for anything you can thank him for food you can thank him for animals you can thank him for the sky you can thank him that you're not dead you can thank him that you have friends but we're going to give him an offering of thanks okay and as we do that the transition from thanksgiving to worship is in ephesians 1. it says that god or paul says pray I like to say the most thrilling thing for your heart is when God reveals God. Like when Holy Spirit shows you God, you would pick it over a roller coaster. You would pick it over skydiving. You would pick it over every other thrill. Because there's something about our heart that when God reveals God, there's nothing better. You're just like, I don't want to be anywhere else. And that's because in that moment, you enter into worship. And we call worship a response to seeing Him. So when God starts to reveal God to your heart, that's when we transition from thanksgiving to worship.

And when this happens, I like to say that how He reveals Himself is what starts to lead worship. So when you read Revelation 4 and 5, and you look at how does heaven worship and pray, Their songs change based on what they're seeing. So, Revelation 4, holy, holy, holy is the Lord. And their song changes to, worthy is the Lamb of God. So, their words on a page are Jesus, the Word of God. Like, He is their words on a page, and they worship based on what Jesus is revealing about Himself. So Jesus is revealing himself as holy in Revelation 4. So they sing holy and they pray holy. But the song changes and the prayers change in Revelation 5 because he starts to reveal himself as the Lamb of God. So they start saying, worthy are you, Lamb of God. You're the one who conquered. right and so you see worship is led in heaven by the revelation of jesus however he wants to reveal himself to heaven in that moment that's how their songs and their prayers change is by the revelation of jesus and so that's what we're after when we're in this worship portion is we all want to see him together okay And then from there, this revelation of Him, right?

It's like, this is how I like to explain it. This is kind of fun. So, we're thanking Jesus, and what happens is Jesus, well, for here, also, we're going to shift to this for a second. Fuel. Go to your fuel sheet. Okay? So, fuel... is an acronym, actually. So, I love the combustible, you know, thing, the names you gave. It's an acronym for Faith, Unity, Encounter, Liberty, okay? And Fuel describes how we do unity in worship, how we pray in unity. And it's also about almost like teamwork in the spirit to worship God. Like we're all on the same team, we're worshiping Him, okay? So, you know, say we're thanking Jesus. And Jonah's like, thank you, Jesus, that you're the Lamb of God. And Susanna's like, thank you, Jesus, that you died on the cross. And Jonathan's like, thank you, Jesus, that I get to be at this farm and for how awesome Harrison is. And then Noah's like, thank you, Jesus, that you love me. And then Daniel's like, thank you, Jesus, that you're beautiful. And we're going around thanking Jesus.

And when we come to pray and worship, Jesus, He's the author and the perfecter of faith, right? So when we gather to pray, He is so excited. He is so thrilled. He is like, wow. My people, they want to pray, and they want to worship. They want to give me this time. And so what I love, I feel like this is kind of a good picture, is Jesus comes in the room, and he's the author of faith, right? And he's got a pen, and it's full of ink. It's like dripping. And what he wants to do is he wants to take his pen, and he wants to author faith. faith on your heart, right? So he comes to Jonah and he's like, let me see your heart. I want to put faith on there. Or he goes over here and he's like, hey, Jonathan. He's in the room because we're gathering. He's like, I want to put faith on your heart, right? Because he's the author and perfecter of faith, and faith comes by hearing, okay? So when we gather, that's what Jesus is like. He's so excited to reveal himself because that's what he always wants to do for us. He's just waiting for us to be positioned in a reverent and awe and grateful position, okay?

that's the first part of fuel faith okay so say that you know we're thanking God and as Jonah he's the one that like he's the first one that feels faith as we're praying he's like whoa oh my gosh like that moment is when like yeah God's my father turns into whoa God's my father oh my gosh It turns from like, yeah, I know He's my Father, to like, wow, He's my Father. And so say that Jonah just starts to see something, and he's like, thank you, Jesus, you're my Father. Wow, Jesus, I worship you as my Father. And then this is the moment where we can go to unity, or we can just all stay individuals. Okay, because the Bible says, I wrote the scripture down there, we submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.

So if Jonah is like, I'm going to step out in faith and be like, hey guys, I really feel like God's revealing himself as father. Let's worship him as father. There's two things I can do. One, I can be like, but God's revealing himself as shepherd to me. So like, I don't really want to do that. Or I could be like, I don't really feel that. That's what I could do if we're going to worship and pray as individuals. But if we want to worship and pray as one, I actually want to submit to Him out of reverence for Christ. And so, He could genuinely be revealing Himself as Shepherd to you, and that's awesome. But because he stepped out in faith, what I'm going to do is I'm going to get behind him. And I'd be like, I agree with you, Jesus. You are Father. You're my Father. You're the Father of lights. You're the Father that brings the prodigal son home. You're the Father that gave me identity. You're our Father. Right? And I'm going to get behind him, actually, and unify with his faith. And then we're all going to do that. Okay, yeah, let's worship His Father. And so we're all going to focus on that one aspect of who God is, and we're going to stay there, right?

So again, this is like, again, like I'm saying, this is a way of prayer. It's not bad for there to be prayer times where it's like, okay, you're getting revelation about something, and that person's like seeing Him as shepherd, and you're seeing Him as king. That's totally fine, right? But if we want to learn how to pray as one, we have to learn to mutually submit to one another. Some people call this listening to one another in the Spirit. I have to pay attention to what you're praying. I can't be distracted. Because if you get faith and we're all just kind of like, yeah, bro, you get your faith. I'm going to stay over here on this thing. Then we're not going to pray as one. but just as the father and son holy spirit are one and they interact as one we can as one interact with them as one and then that is like this beautiful glorious unity that god wants us to have okay

so faith so jonah gets faith god's father i'm like i'm getting behind you joan i want to see that too okay and then it says encounter okay then because we're submitting our reverence for Christ we start to encounter God together okay so we're like just like in heaven that they're all seeing him as holy now we're all seeing him as father and we're like wow he's our father oh my gosh the father he's so loving he's so merciful oh my gosh and we're all like loving on God as father okay and that's what it means here when it says to love the name of the lord so the reason we unify around one aspect of who he is is because i want to love the name of the lord is his name being revealed as father today is it the lamb of god is it provider right so we all start to worship him and adore his name Whatever name He's revealing today. We unify around His name. Or John 17, Father, would you protect them in your name? Father, would you give them your name? Right? So this is what the name of God brings unity around us, okay?

And then the last one is liberty, right? So, I put a verse under there. It says, the Father is looking for those who will worship Him in spirit and in truth. Okay? And the Bible says, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there's freedom. And it also says, the truth will set you free. So, when we're worshiping like this, we're letting the Holy Spirit lead us to a truth about God that And that is what worshiping in spirit and in truth is about. And then, because there's freedom where the Spirit of the Lord is, and the truth sets us free, it's an explosion of freedom. Liberty is in the room. God wants to set people free. He wants you to be free of every little thing that's in your life. And we're worshiping like this, He releases freedom because we're worshiping the way He wants us to worship, which is letting Holy Spirit be the worship leader, reveal the truth about Jesus, and that releases freedom in our hearts and in the room. Okay? Does that somewhat make sense?

okay awesome somewhat so from there okay so we're i love i love this too because usually like we've all been in prayer meetings before where it's like this person's praying for like something over there and like you're praying for something over there and then that person over there is praying for something like over there and we're all kind of like where are we going You had a prayer meeting, right? Or you've been to a prayer meeting where it's all like, everyone's kind of like their own individual. You know, they're like, I have this really good prayer I'm about to pray after like those two people are done praying. But it's like, well, we want to be in unity when we pray, you know? I don't want to just pray as me. I want to see what you're seeing, and I want to see what you want to see happen in the earth. So I'm going to agree with you in intercession. I want to agree with you and see what you're seeing in worship. It's almost like sometimes you're more after getting behind somebody else's revelation than getting your own revelation. That, I feel like, is part of the humility God's after in prayer. I don't care who gets the revelation, I just want to see God. So whoever starts to see God first, I want to get behind them immediately. I don't want to feel like I have to get my revelation and you get your revelation. I want to be like, whoever starts seeing Jesus by the Spirit of God, I'm just going to dive behind you immediately. Because I want to see God. And I don't care who's the first one to step out in faith. You know? So, anyways, you can go for a while on that.

But from there, the reason it's called a fuel is now your heart's burning. because you're seeing Jesus together. So it's almost like you have fuel to intercede now. There's fresh faith on your heart to pray because Jesus just put his pen to your heart. So you're like, oh man, I've wanted to stop worshiping for probably 10 minutes, but I've endured longer worship because I want to grow in worship. But man, I want to intercede so bad. And so with that fresh faith, you're like, whoever's facilitating will be like, okay, God, like, guys, we're going to pray for Kenya today, okay? And you're like, all right. He's revealing himself as Father. Jonah's like, we're praying for Kenya. We're like, alright, we're behind you Jonah, let's pray for Kenya. And we're like, God, we use that revelation as the intercession. So we're like, God, release the spirit of adoption over Kenya today, God. I pray that every orphan would get a touch of you in Kenya today. Lord, I pray that every fatherless person would get identity straight from heaven. Father, I just pray that the spirit of adoption would run rampant in Kenya today, God. Show them the glory of the Father that Jesus prayed that we would see. You know, and you start praying from that revelation of the Father into that place, right? And so, you're in heaven, our Father in heaven with one another. You're thanking Jesus. He reveals something. You start to worship Him as that. And then from that place, let your kingdom come and let your will be done. And you start praying what He's revealing over a place. Because the Bible says, the gospel is not man's gospel. I received it as a revelation of Jesus Christ. So then the gospel goes forth through your prayers, wherever you're praying, so that people can see God and put their faith in God. Okay?

And I love, we put a scripture here next intercession. It's Ezekiel 2230. The scripture says that God sought for a man who would stand in the gap on behalf of the city so that he wouldn't have to destroy it. Which is like, and unfortunately the verse ends and says, but he found no one. So he had to destroy it. But God will find people here in Switzerland in Jesus' name. So when we're worshiping and we're thanking Jesus, we're positioning ourselves to be found by God to stand in a gap between heaven and earth somewhere. So it could be a city, it could be your business, it could be the hospital, it could be your family, but God has an eye that's always looking for somebody that will pray with Him. Because He's praying non-stop all the time. And His eye is looking for somebody to join Him in His own personal 24-7 prayer meeting. Okay? So that's kind of TWI. So, let me do really simple, simple terms TWI one more time. We thank Jesus until Holy Spirit reveals Jesus. Once Holy Spirit reveals Jesus, we worship Him for whatever He reveals. And once we worship Him for whatever He reveals, we then begin to intercede for whatever He wants to release in the earth. Okay? Pretty simple.
