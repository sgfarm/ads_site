Okay, so today we're going to talk about discipleship. I love this topic. It's going to be so fun. And so, first things first, I want to, this is a classic scripture, but I want to read Matthew 28:18-20. Let's start here.

> "And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age." Matthew 28:20

And you can flip here if you want as well, but I just want to read as well Genesis 1:27-28. I just want to connect a few dots here, a little bit from Old to New Testament.

> "So God created man in His own image. In the image of God, He created him. Male and female He created them, and God blessed them. And God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves on the earth." Genesis 1:27-28

The reason I connect those is it's funny how similar that is. From the beginning, God has wanted us to be people that are fruitful and multiply. Then he also says in Matthew 28, it's not the exact same thing, I realize, but again, he gives this similar commission of, hey, I'm actually taking back the authority that you gave away in the garden.

So that we can do what you were supposed to do the first time, which was to be fruitful and multiply. And another thing is, he's speaking to a group of like, I don't even know how many people this is. This is probably like 50 people. This might have just been his disciples. I can't remember exactly. We can look at the context. But think about how daunting or like how overwhelming this task must have felt to them.

"Hey, I know most of you don't even know how to read. Can you go ahead and make disciples of all nations for me?" That is an insane task, to give twelve men who are illiterate. "Hey, all authority in heaven and earth has been given to me, therefore go and make disciples of all nations."

And so that's a really big task, and the task is still the same for us. And it may seem daunting, but that's why it requires faith. It requires faith to believe, okay, wait, God could actually use us to make disciples of all nations. And when He says all, He means all. And so this requires faith. And I want us to notice that it says, a lot of times we don't feel equipped, like, "I don't know if I'm equipped to make disciples, if I'm ready for this. I think I need to do seminary for four years, and then I'll be ready." And we kind of push off discipleship for years sometimes before we feel like we're ready to do it. But he makes it clear, teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you. You know, discipleship doesn't have to be that revelatory. Does that word make sense? You don't have to be insanely gifted to make disciples.

Because it's about obedience. It's not about if you're gifted. If you're gifted enough and you can preach, then you can make disciples. Or, man, if you're really prophetic, you can make disciples. Or, if you're really smart, you can make disciples. It says none of that. It's just about teaching people to obey, which basically means, if you can read to somebody the Bible, or you can figure out what the Bible says, then you can disciple somebody. Because it's about hearing the Word and doing the Word. And so, it's as simple as, "okay, the Bible says to love my neighbor".

Here would be a really simple discipleship day. "Hey guys, how's it going? We're going to read Love Your Neighbor As Yourself today." Literally one verse, love your neighbor as yourself. "Okay, how can we apply that? Let's make some cookies for our neighbor." Okay, you make cookies, go do it. Way to go, you just obeyed God. That would be a legitimate discipleship time.

And you can do this with both a believer and an unbeliever. There's so many times that people have just asked an unbeliever, hey, do you want to read the Bible with me? And then they make it a part of their time of reading the Bible. "Hey, how do you want to apply this this week?" And then they're like, "I'm going to do this." And you're like, okay, great. And then you have unbelievers obeying God. And they start to learn the ways of God. And then after a few times reading the Bible, they realize, I think I want to give my life to Jesus. This is what I'm called to do. I'm made to obey Jesus. And they give their lives to Jesus.

And then some believers, a lot of times, it's like we've gotten over-trained almost. Like we've gotten a lot of knowledge, but not a lot of actually applying. And they need the challenge to actually do it. So you might be with them, and they'll be like, "yeah, that's good." If we read about prayer this week, I'll be like, "how are you going to apply that?" And they're like, "well, I'm going to pray this week." And then I'm going to be like, "well, when?"

And they're going to be like, "what do you mean when?" I'm like, "when?" Like, when are you going to actually do that? I want to help keep you accountable to do that. Not because I want to put an expectation on somebody, like, or a shame thing on them. But because I love them, I want them to become obedient to Jesus. And I want to help them get there. It's all about helping people become obedient to Jesus.

Okay. And this is kind of long to write down. Maybe I'll write it down later. But my working definition of discipleship is one person helping another person become a lifelong obedient follower of Jesus who in turn helps others do the same.

Okay? So again, just to be clear, it's that simple. You don't have to be that gifted. If you can sit down with somebody and read the Bible and do it with them, and even be willing to model it with them, like, you're helping, you're being a disciple, and you're helping make disciples. And again, when we're making disciples, I love at the end where it says, who in turn helps others do the same. So I want to teach others, no matter who they are, how gifted they are, that they can also do what I'm doing with them, with somebody else.

So even a lot of times, even in Waco, sometimes I'll have specific discipleship groups, and one of the expectations I'll say at the beginning of starting is, hey, I want to invest in y'all, I love you guys, but I want to tell y'all, this isn't just going to be you and me. My expectation for this is that you are going to find somebody to invest this stuff in as well.

Who is in your life that needs this as well, and who are you going to give it away to? So I'll make that kind of expectation at the beginning of like, I expect that y'all are going to give this to somebody as well. And then honestly, sometimes if they're not willing, and they're not being obedient, and they're not actually following Jesus, I'll bless them, but I won't meet with them anymore.

Not because I have anything against them. I still love them. But it's not good for us, actually. Because I'm going to keep challenging you to obey. And if you're going to start getting offended, then eventually this is going to be bad for our relationship. You're going to end up not liking me.

And I'm okay with people not liking me, but not unnecessarily. If you don't want to actually be a disciple of Jesus, that's totally fine with me. I mean, I wish you wouldn't. It's sad. But I'm fine letting you do your thing until you're ready to. Okay. So another thing about discipleship, we go to Matthew 4, 18-22. Now,

> "And he said to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." Matthew 4:19

So one of the things I want to highlight here is it says, He'll make us fishers of men. Anyone in here been fishing before? \[people talking\] But when you fish, I mean, it depends where you fish, but typically when you fish, do you catch one, like, within the first two seconds? Sometimes. Sometimes.

In most places when you fish, do you feel like you usually catch one within the first two seconds? No. No. Thank you, Samuel. So a lot of times, right, like we want to share the gospel, you know, for some of us. Like you go to evangelism, or you do an outreach somewhere, and most people just kind of like had a like aversion to you. They're like, "ah, get away from me", you know or things like that. Or you're like man this is kind of hard like I reached out to a lot of people they didn't want to or like I talked to my friend about it and they were like no I'm good and then but then you find this person you didn't think would want it and they do want it and you're like oh okay okay praise god I didn't think that person was they weren't as gifted but like that's okay.

But then they become somebody, you start reading the Bible with them, you start modeling what it looks like to see Jesus, to pray, and they want to come, and they want to do that with you, and you get to help develop them, become an obedient follower of Jesus, and then you don't just fish for them, you give them a pole as well, and you say, "hey, why don't you go fishing now too?"

And why don't you just start throwing that out there and see who bites, you know? So discipleship is kind of like that. Like there's been times, I know plenty of stories and I've seen it happen where somebody literally gets dramatically healed. Like I'm talking broken bones, completely healed. And we're like, Hey, like we share the gospel with them. They're like, "nah, I'm good." And you're like, "you just like, God just healed your arm." Like, "yeah, but I don't really feel like living that way. I don't really believe that thing."

And "you're like, you just got healed." But they don't bite when it comes to discipleship. They don't want to follow Jesus. They're grateful that he's a healer. Like in the Bible, you see this. The New Testament, they're like, yeah, he's a prophet. He's a healer. He's kind of like Elijah.

"But I don't want to follow him, though. I'm going to keep my distance from that guy." But then there's times where somebody does get healed, and they're like, yes, tell me about this man Jesus. I want to follow him. And then they're like, I want that. I want to be reeled in. I want to be taught to be a disciple.

And so, if you fish for like two minutes, and you don't catch anything, and you leave, I mean, you need to grow in perseverance, and patience, and discipleship, and in making disciples. You don't just catch fish in like two seconds every time. You don't just watch your neighbor, and you're like, hey, this, and they're like, yes, that's everything I ever wanted, you know?

That's not usually what happens, you know. There's times where that happens, when God just pours out the Holy Spirit in Pentecost, and it's like, oh my gosh, 3,000 in one day, and then Acts 4 again, and Acts 8 again. There's times where God pours out the Holy Spirit. So it's not an expression of unbelief in those things, or what God can do.

But we have to be patient in discipleship to make disciples. It's funny. There was a guy at our church in Waco. He had all this vision for planning a house church. He's like, I'm going to do it. He's a 20-year-old college student. Just got totally... Or got encountered by God on this trip we had. And he is thrilled about Jesus. He's like...

Someone asks him, hey, do you want to lead a house church? And he's like, "I'm going to do it. Let's go." And his vision's like, "I'm going to have 40 people at this house church, and worship's going to be amazing", and all this stuff. And he's full of vision for it. And then that year, he spends the whole year, he said, with four and a half people in his life group or house church.

And he's like, "what the heck, God? I was so excited for everything. I did all the things. I crossed all the X's. I did everything I was supposed to do. And I have four and a half people coming to my house church every week." And it's four and a half because they showed up once a month out of the weekly house church. And sometimes we call them life groups. So he was like, "yeah, I call that my death group year".

But what was funny is the things he was praying and the things that he was hearing from God were these bigger things. Well, what happened next year is that did happen. He had like 30, 40 people that were coming. And at the end of that first year, it was only four or five, four and a half people who didn't really want to be disciples, but they wanted to come to house church. And he was in this dance the whole time relationally.

He was like, "okay, God. I just asked for five. I pray you give me five disciples. I want to invest in five guys this next year." And that's what he got. He had this group of like about 30 to 40 people that would come, but there was five guys that he had time to invest in, and he invested in those five. And then he invested in them to where he was like, and you're going to invest in people. And then those five invested in 25. And then those 25 started investing in whatever 20, you know, 100, whatever it is, right?

And that's how discipleship is supposed to work. It's that multiplication. What five people can do that are investing in a total of 25, and then 25 and 125 is going to be more powerful than five gifted people that do everything for the 200. Does that make sense?

And so we have to learn to be patient in discipleship and not get discouraged. Sometimes we connect our value to how many disciples we have. Or sometimes we connect our value to the outcome of trying to start discipling people. And we have to be patient and perseverant in that. Okay. I want to read that scripture. John 13:34-35.

> "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, just as I have loved you. You also are to love one another. By this, all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another." John 13:34-35

That's an insane promise. There's the practical outworking of we want new people that don't know Jesus to be discipled and to grow and have a relationship with Jesus. But do we know that the spirit of revelation can rest on our relationships if we love one another?

Me and Daniel could go to a restaurant in Luzerne and because we love one another so much, somebody could just watch us talking and see Jesus and be like, I want that. You can come to our table and be like, what's up with y'all? And we'd be like, what do you mean? And we'd be like, there's something about y'all. What is it? And we're like, oh, that's Jesus. We love one another. We actually do. It's not just saying that. We don't just tolerate one another.

You know what I mean? Like that is a discipleship strategy above all strategies is that you actually have love for one another and that we grow in love for one another.

I remember I was at a conference with a thousand Chinese house church leaders from China, and when I don't know their language, I just watched them interact, and it marked my life. I just saw them love one another and interact with one another, and the spirit of revelation rested, in that real way on them.

That all I remember saying in my heart was, God, I will die for whatever that is. Like, that is love for one another. And I think God wants that, like, back upon us. Where literally, we don't even have to say anything. Like, the people just watch us live our lives amongst one another. And we're like a magnet for the glory of God. And for people to want to know Jesus. So important.

Okay, another scripture, Jeremiah 31:34.

So I use this scripture because discipleship is about us helping people learn how to obey Jesus, not us. It's teaching them how to learn from Jesus Himself. And that takes all the pressure off of you. Like I said, you don't have to be that gifted.

Don't have to be whoever you look up to most in the Christian world. Because it's about them learning from Jesus. And Jesus wants to disciple them more than you do. And He desires a relationship with them more than you do. And we get to partner with Him to help them get there.

But the weight gets taken off you because it's the Holy Spirit who is their primary discipler, and you're just trying your best to help them connect to the Holy Spirit so that they can be discipled by God. And this really does, it takes all the weight off of you because it's about them learning from Jesus, not about you knowing enough or all those different things.

Okay? And with this, I'm gonna go to the board. I want you to get your papers out. Okay? Okay. Okay.

Okay, so up top, I'm going to put this. This is, and I want y'all to draw this with me because you want to keep this around. You can, if you want to do it in German, Spanish, translate it, go for it. So up top is high challenge. Okay.

Or actually, sorry, challenge, my bad. It's just supposed to be a challenge. Okay. Down low is invitation. I'm going to abbreviate it. Y'all know invitation. Okay. Okay.

Let's check. One sec. I want to make sure I get this right. Welcome. Welcome. Hey. Okay. Yeah.

okay one sec butchering this a little bit so be patient here okay my bad so low invitation high invitation okay sorry about this okay and then we're gonna do over here is high challenge

low challenge this is low okay so this is kind of this chart is kind of about like church culture okay and what God desires it to be according to the scriptures okay so

When you have a high invitation, but a low challenge environment, what happens? For example, say you invite people all the time. You're like, we have so many events, we're inviting people, all this stuff, and we have people that come, it's really good, but nobody's really being challenged to do what God says outside of those events.

nobody's like calling you to like actually obey God it's more how do I call them to my next event or my next service but there's not like so there's a ton of invitation you might you feel welcome there which is good but if you're honest like outside of that you're kind of like I don't feel like I'm really doing it the way the Bible says right this is what creates consumers okay

So people come and they take what you give them, right? Because there's a lot of invitation. You come to it, right? And again, so you know, I'm not thinking about any specific person as I say this. This isn't like a judgment talk. I'm just showing you how it can be sometimes and where God wants it to be, right? This creates consumers and a comfortable culture

Because since there's no challenge, there's not really like iron on iron. There's no confrontation. We don't want to make you feel bad. We don't want to offend you. But you can come. You can come to our services. We want to teach. We want you to have a good life and a good time at our events. And yeah.

And a lot of times, what can happen that's really hard with this is people will, it's like, we want you to come, but we want you to come because we're afraid of losing people. Or we're afraid of losing money because people would leave and not tie to us. Or we're afraid of losing our reputation, so I don't want to challenge you because then you might get mad at me and write something online about me.

You know, like that's, it's real, you know, these are real like temptations with this stuff. Right. Okay. And then down here you have low challenge and low invitation, low challenge, low invitation. And this is what creates a boring culture. Boring. And I'll put apathetic.

This is kind of like, you know, like it's a cultural thing that we go to church. So like, I don't know, we'll go on Sunday. If I don't feel like going on Sunday, I'll at least go on Easter. Because it's like a family event and tradition in our culture. And so that's what I do. But if I'm honest, we're all falling asleep during the service. And after this, we're just going to get some food.

right so this would be the low invitation low challenge culture it's just kind of boring apathetic maybe it's a cultural thing that we're supposed to do this everyone feels guilty if they don't go so i guess we should go you know like i feel like i'm a bad person if i don't go so i'll go that's that okay we don't want that okay and then

We go over here, so over here we have high challenge and we have low invitation, okay? So we're like, oh, okay, we're back like even level possibly over here. But this is kind of like stressful. Sorry, this is such bad handwriting. Stressful, it can be legalistic. And then usually people are just discouraged.

So discouraged, stressful, and legalistic. So it's kind of like everyone has these like really high expectations, but since I'm not inviting you into my life, no one knows what those expectations actually are. And so like we're all a little concerned that we're like not doing it because we're not talking and like you don't actually know me.

but we're going to preach really intense passages, and we're going to call you to these big things, but we're not really friends. We're not really family here, so you're not going to know how to do it because I'm not modeling it, and we're not close enough for you to feel like you can fail."

front of me and so you'll just kind of feel discouraged and a little stressed out because like the people up top they're like really going for they're passionate and zealous but you're kind of like you're like hoorah to like them but like how do you do that I have no idea how you do that and you're telling me to do it so I feel pressure to do it and

But I don't feel like I can do it because... Does that make sense? Am I making sense? So it's like you have a super high challenge, but because there's not invitation, you can actually know my life. I'll tell you my weakness. You can know my family. Here's my story. Here's I met Jesus. Do you want to do this with me to learn how to do that? Hey, are you new to prophesying? Come and prophesy over somebody with me. Hey, are you new to...

You grew up in a really unhealthy family. I want to show you actually my family that God's given health to so you can have a new version of that. It's like there's no invitation into my life. It's just like, hey, we're all telling you what you should be doing, and we all feel pressured to do it, but we're not doing it because you're really anxious, or we are doing it, but we're doing it wrong, but at least you're happy that I'm doing it. So then we'll raise you up as a leader.

Right? Okay. And then over here, this is what we call discipleship. Or, I'll also call it empowerment culture. Healthy empowerment. Which is high challenge and high invitation. Okay? So, even as you're looking at this,

I'm saying a lot. So to say a little bit about this, right? This is what Jesus did, right? He's the one that, you know, He shows up, like we read, to these fishermen, and He gives them a high challenge and a high invitation. He says, drop your nets and follow me. That's a high challenge. They've been fishing their whole lives. Like, maybe not their whole lives, but for years at least, they've been fishing.

And they don't even know this guy that well. They've probably heard about him. But he's like, hey, drop your nets and the job you're doing, follow me. That's high challenge. That's high invitation, right? He says, hey, if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood, you cannot be my disciple. High invitation, high challenge, right?

And you see this all throughout Scripture. The disciples, they say something silly, He gives them a really big challenge. And He invites them to see a different way. And so all throughout Jesus' life, you see Him, high challenge, high invitation. And right, you have people, there's like 5,000 people that are around Him, and that's when He says, eat my flesh, drink my blood, and most of them leave. So He wasn't afraid to lose people, even though He loved them.

So he wasn't trying to keep everybody around and be like, hi invitation, no challenge. Cause I want to keep the people. There's like, I got a, I got a big crowd going, got a lot of followers, you know, like I'll put this on Instagram. You know, he wasn't afraid to lose people. You even see this in the prodigal son story. He lets the prodigal leave because he's that committed to not, to not having a spirit of control. He won't force you control you until the day he returns. Then he will.

And that is a discipleship empowerment culture that we want to have. It's where we feel the faith and confidence to invite, but also challenge in our relationships, in our lives. Okay, so somebody tell me something. When I go through all this, can you think of examples in your own life where maybe you felt one of these four?

Tell me about it, John. Let's see. How do I say this kindly? I've been in environments that have tried to disciple people, but they're worried

that they're not going to be able to disciple people if they challenge them too much and just leave. Yeah, yeah. And so then it's like the challenge is low. Uh-huh. And so then people are like, I guess this is how we're supposed to do it. And they sort of go their own way while still being attached to the, like,

They're still invited, so they're still there. Yeah. But they're not, like, doing what they're supposed to. Yeah, totally. It's good. You know, you said you've experienced this? Yeah, I did. So, I think in both areas, consumers and comfortable, and then boring and... Apathetic.

Apathetic. Apathetic. Like, don't care. I mean, in a way. Yeah, how do I say this nicely? Totally, totally. So, I have been part of a church. And I was pretty much a consumer. So...

You don't have to go into depth if you don't want to. Yeah, how do I say this? And there were, like, people in the leadership team that just acted in a way that, okay, I want to confront you, but there was confrontation, but at the same time, I didn't mean it like that, you know, like, to put you back in a comfortable place. Yeah, yeah. And just...

In a way, it was like, I use you, you use me. It was like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, totally. And again, like, a lot of us, like, we've been a part of something like these three. And again, too, right, like, most of the time, like, people that are leading these things, like, leading things in this way, they don't mean to be doing that.

They're not some evil intentioned person that's trying to make you a consumer. They're doing the best that they know how, and Jesus has mercy for those people. He says, have mercy on them, Father, you know what they do.

Because people don't know they're doing that, you know? And so we don't have to be judging people or things like that. But a lot of times we don't realize that we have a mindset from one of these three. Like, this is how I think about following Jesus. That I come, I have something that somebody teaches me, and I don't really do anything with it.

and I don't give it to somebody else. Or you're so used to boring and apathetic that your expectation when we gather to actually have an encounter with God is really, really low.

I don't know if God can really do that. That kind of thing. Or over here, you're so used to a culture that's like pressure, stress, that you just have to keep going. You've just got to keep doing and performing and earning until you don't even realize your heart's cold to the blood of Jesus. And you're missing Jesus because you're doing and doing and doing and doing and doing and doing, but you're not listening anymore. You've closed your ears to Jesus.

Right? And this is what Jesus wants to train us out of and into this.

of discipleship and empowerment. And here's the thing too. When people start to come out of these three into this other one, also it's a refining process for everybody. And what's hard about this is you find out what people actually want to follow God.

and which ones don't, you know? So, it's like you can't hide in this environment, because I'm letting you into my life, and you're letting you into my life, and if you don't want to actually follow Jesus, like, you can't really hide it, you know? It's like family. You can't really hide things in your family that well. Like, they're around you enough to be able to read you, you know, like...

It's the same thing with this. You just can't. There's no hiding. You can't just come in here and think it's gonna work where you're not gonna get a question throughout the time that's gonna make you have to open up or cause you have to share something you didn't really wanna share or like,

Well, there's this one time that I messed up really bad and I'm really ashamed of it. Eventually, that's going to come up and out. And so, if you don't really want Jesus, this is going to prune that person out.

And that's why you see in the book of Acts, people get really angry at people sometimes for the wrong reasons. That's kind of part of the cost of this. None of these three, unless there's repentance, are going to be able to work out in this.

The whole world is trying to teach us that tolerance and grace are the same thing, and they're not. Grace is repentance. Jesus has given us a chance to repent and to turn back to Him.

And so, in this environment, you fall in love with repentance, because everyone wants to be like Jesus. But if you don't want to be like Jesus, we all find out, and then it's awkward, and it's like, okay, what you've been doing in these atmospheres has all been fake. So this is just weird now. So we still love you, but we might stop high challenge and high invitation in this relationship, because you don't want it anymore.

Like I said in the beginning, if somebody's showing, like, I don't want to obey God, I don't need to do these two things with them until I discern that they're ready to obey God, because then you just get into unnecessary suffering in a relationship that wasn't supposed to work yet, because they don't want to follow God yet.

And so, this is what we're after over here, is discipleship and empowerment. And in this, right, anybody can make disciples, right? Over in here, in this one, it's kind of like we have the teacher on stage, and he disciples everybody, okay? And he might, like, tell us to pray, and he might tell us to seek God, which is good, you know, but...

he's not like getting in my life on a like good relationship level to where we can challenge and we can we can interact and you can help me repent of my lies and then like growing the truth and those different things and learn to pray and so what's up so then with this with consumers on the comfortable place or it's like if it's in churches

That's good, I agree. And so over here,

The focus, like he's saying, it's the people. It's not bad if you have good production during worship. It's not bad if you have good music. It's not bad if you have a stage. It's not bad if you have a Sunday service. It's not bad if people preach. It's not bad if people prophesy. Those different things. We want to empower the gifts of the Spirit of God to be used in our midst.

But we're not using those so that somebody becomes the idol of the church. Like, oh, that's the gifted one. We all really love him.

That's how we learn from God. He is our shepherd and He feeds us. We all have gifts from the Spirit of God that we all get to use. Sometimes people get to use them in front of more people. There's nothing wrong with that. Totally neutral. I think people are called to preach on stages. They're called to do big crusades. We need that.

Everyone is called to be a disciple, no matter where you're from, what you've done, how gifted you are, and we want you to learn how to obey and follow Jesus in that way. Okay? So does this kind of make sense? Yes? Yeah? And that's what we're after. Okay? I want to read another scripture here as we're going through this. It's Ecclesiastes 9, 13 through 18.

Ecclesiastes 9, 13 through 18. Ecclesiastes 9, 13 through 18, yeah. Proverbs, right? Yeah.

Guys, don't sleep on Ecclesiastes, guys. Ecclesiastes 9, 13 through 18. Okay.

This scripture is like, I love this scripture so much. It's so good. It says, I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me. There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siege works against it. But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city.

Yet no one remembered that poor man. But I say that wisdom is better than might. Though the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard, the words of the wise, heard and quiet, are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools. Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.

I just read this a couple years ago, and I was like, this is discipleship. It's the words of the wise heard in quiet. I think we've talked a little bit about the Mauravians. We've mentioned the Mauravians. They were really like this. Do you know William Wilberforce? People know William Wilberforce in here? Reformationist from England. He ended slavery.

He and a group of friends were these abolitionists, which is like people that advocate for freedom of somebody from slavery. And they were the ones in England, him and his friends, that over years of time lived a life like this and saw slavery abolished in England and then the rest of Europe. But most people don't know that Wilberforce was powerfully impacted by the Mauravians.

that had a 100-year 24-7 prayer meeting. He had a run-in with the Mauravians, and he got baptized in the Holy Spirit, and had powerful interactions with them that really initiated what him and his friends did. But no one remembers the Mauravians, just like no one remembers this poor wise man.

And John Wesley, he had a powerful encounter along with the Mauravians. He was on a ship at sea that they thought was going to get destroyed because there was a storm. And he goes down into the bottom of the boat, and there's a Moravian family just praying and worshiping the peace of God. And he's like, everyone else is freaking out. What are these people doing down here like nothing's happening? But then he realizes they're worshiping.

And he ends up having a long couple days of conversation with them because he had gone to seminary school, all these different things. After talking to them, he realized he didn't even think he was saved. So he got born again with Mauravians. And then he went back. And then obviously we see him having a huge impact both in England and the Americas, right?

But it was the Mauravians, again, that were the turning point for this guy. It was the words of wise people that were the Mauravians that influenced the influencers. But they don't remember. And a lot of times this is what discipleship is like, right? Discipleship is about investing in a few and challenging them to invest in a few. And then those people challenged other people to invest in a few.

Right. And then you have no idea like what impact a lot of times that's going to have, you know. And so I like and again, influence, you know, it's not a partiality thing of like we influencing is better and we're like the low key people or something.

But this is part of how God has designed it, that wherever you are in life, whether you're in full-time ministry or you're working a job, you're called to make disciples and learn how to start spiritual conversations with people

and then invite them into reading the Bible. Invite them into learning about Jesus and the ways of Jesus. I have a bunch of different friends that work in different places. They've worked in government and they would just start spiritual conversations with people at work. I have a friend, he's a manager of 20 people and he sees himself as their pastor.

and he has check-ins with them about their well-being, and oftentimes that's where he gets to share the gospel, and he's seen multiple of them come and know Jesus, and then he started discipling them, and then they start discipling people. And so discipleship, it's almost like this disease that just kind of spreads slowly but surely and turns into this whole COVID thing.

type of thing, you know? But it's for anybody, right? That's what I love about it. It's for anybody. Like, you don't have to be that gifted. You don't have to be the guy on stage. Everyone is empowered to play a part in discipling people, you know, if you believe in Jesus. And you don't have to have five years of learning how to follow God to start discipling people. Once you've encountered God and you've taken your first step, now you're ready to make disciples.

Okay? So I'm going to read one more scripture. 2 Timothy 2, verses 2. We can start in 2 Timothy 2, verse 1, just because it's all one sentence. 2 Timothy 2, verses 1 through 2.

2 Timothy 2, verses 1 through 2. It says, I'm going to read that second verse again. I'm going to read that second verse again.

This is what Paul did as well. He found people, faithful people, people that believed in Jesus and were learning to follow Him, and he entrusted them to teach others also. This is how he did things. He wanted to make disciples that made disciples.

That's what I believe God's calling all of us to do is, okay, who are the people in my life that I could invest in? And I think also He's calling us to kind of, what's the word, almost unlearn any mindsets we picked up from this stuff that's not here.

I love teaching this stuff because it's helpful, but a lot of times we have to learn this part too. How do I unlearn these things that I just picked up naturally from being in a culture like that? How do I walk into this culture of like, wait, I have something to give. The Spirit of God lives in me. I have a relationship with Jesus, and people need a relationship with Jesus, and so I can give it away. Okay?

Does that make sense? Okay. So, one more question. Is there any, like, one, is there any questions, two, do you feel like there's anything that's kind of, like, just jogging your mind about this? You're like, oh, like, I can see where that happened to me or I can see where this needs to shift in how I think or anything like that?

I think I'm just now realizing, like, I know I knew this, but I'm just now realizing that, like, Jesus didn't say to now go forth into all the nations and spread the gospel. Mm-hmm. Yeah. He said make disciples. Yeah. It's pretty interesting. Mm-hmm.

Anybody else? Things that you're realizing you need to unlearn, or even just things that you're picking up from this, you're like, oh, I haven't thought about it that way. Yeah. Yeah.

or the pastor and talking about things if it makes sense yes or no something's good something's bad and always had to discern myself and to prove what he said is right yes or no I was not really discipleship involved in it and this would be something very very good if they can start with this yes yes

Anybody else? Any thoughts or things stick out to you? I think all of us, or not all of us, but many of us, we pass for all, no? I can't see the transitions.

in my life when I was very... Yeah, yeah. Another very... Yeah, yeah. Another time more activity, another time more...

I am upset. I am uncomfortable. I don't want to do this. And finally, now we are in another session. So I can see me in different moments. Yeah, different places you felt. Yeah, totally. Anybody else? I want to say something very important today.

and the people is church so if we love this we love the purpose of the why Jesus created the church so I think it's very basic and very simple and very difficult to stay focused on loving the people yeah I think maybe all these different kinds they don't

teach or are this way they don't really understand who jesus is maybe yeah if they would know him they would not lead the church this way yes yeah i think um it is about knowing him yes if you only can build a healthy discipleship if you know

Yes, so good. Anybody else? Thoughts or questions on this?

with consumers and comfortable without the high invitation and low challenge that's i also want to like and there's also big events events we have like big events holy spirit night europe and everything i'm not really i'm not quite sure how's the discipleship

Yes, totally. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, yeah.

Yes. Yes. Yes, totally. It's really good. Yes. And that's the thing you see too, is like, we're not trying to lead people to events.

We're trying to lead people to Jesus. So that's what I've had a lot with this high invitation, low challenge, is people learn how to get to the next event. But this is what leads you to a lifestyle of following Jesus. I wake up and I seek Him first in His righteousness. And I go to work and I don't complain with everybody else. I'm not afraid like everybody else.

I love Jesus at work. I pray at the workplace. You know what I mean? It's like you also, like the secular, sacred divide we create in our minds starts to crash down because you're like, oh, I can know Jesus anywhere.

And you don't even realize that you think, you realize, wow, my encounters with Jesus have been at this building, but I haven't been anywhere else. That's weird. How did that happen? And then you realize, oh, wait, it's because I didn't know my mind got trained that...

I connect Jesus to a location or a place and not a person. Or I connect the church to a building and not a people, right? And again, like I said, buildings aren't wrong. I'm fine with buildings. It's great to have a space together, right?

But we want people to feel invited by Jesus, to know Him, to follow Him, to obey Him, to learn from Him. It's all about Jesus, and this makes Jesus accessible for everybody. Everybody can know Him.

Whether you're working as a construction worker, you're at a hospital, you're in ministry and that's your job, whatever it is, all can know Him and all can learn from Him and all can follow Him. And that's a lot of what this is about and how we want to transition into. What's up, John? So, when I'm discipling somebody, how do I know that I'm leading them to

That's a great question. There's probably a lot of practical questions of like, okay, so if people want to be a disciple, what do I do with them? Right? Okay. I feel like that's like a whole other teaching. But I'll say a few things. Like for myself personally, if they already believe in Jesus, the first thing I'm going to do is,

is I'm going to go to their house at like 6 a.m., and we're going to spend time with Jesus. They're going to learn. I'm going to just model how I spend time with Jesus in the morning, and I'm going to help them learn to do that too, because then I'm going to help them start to learn from Jesus.

And I know if I can help them establish a devotional life of waking up and seeking Him and His righteousness first, it literally says, all things will be added to you if you get that one thing down. You know? So I'm like, that's always the first thing I'm after is the scriptures and getting them connected to Jesus on a daily basis behind closed doors. Because if they can get that, they can learn everything else from Him.

And they'll need the body because Christ is in His church. And so I can depend on Jesus as I depend on y'all. But that's always the first thing I do. And then from there, I just take the Bible and I just do what the Bible says with them. So say, share the gospel. They haven't shared the gospel before. Okay, we're going to go to the grocery down the road and we're going to pray outside the grocery and ask the Holy Spirit if He wants to say anything.

And then we're going to go inside the grocery and we're going to be like, walk up to somebody that's going to feel awkward because it's their first time. And they're going to be like, hey, I'm Harrison. They're like, why are you talking to me? Oh, not a big deal. I know this is weird, but like.

Is there any way I can pray for you? And the person might be like, I'm good. Or they might be like, wow, that's crazy. Yeah, totally. There's actually this really bad thing going on in my life, and I need God. And you're like, okay, great. What's going on? Let's pray. And then you pray, you share Jesus. So I'm going to literally just do the things the Bible says alongside them so that we can learn how to do it together. Because I'm still growing, and they're still growing,

And I might be a little bit older in my faith to be able to coach them and help them through some of the stuff that I needed help getting through to grow and obeying God in different ways. But I'm just going to simply do the Bible with them. Or we're going to read the Bible and it says to pray. And I'm going to be like, all right, so we're going to pray for the next 20 minutes.

What do you want to pray for? You know, it's like literally that simple. But we're always so like up here thinking it has to be so extravagant. And God is so down here where they're at. And he's so fine. Like I might not need to be asking somebody to try and spend two hours with God in the morning every day if they just met God. I'll probably ask them to spend 20 minutes. And that would be like a big step for them.

Does that make sense? Am I making sense with that? Like, I'm just simply doing the Bible with them. And sometimes I might just be reading the Bible with them and then being like, hey, how do you want to obey this week? And they'll be like, well, I need to forgive my mom because she said this thing two weeks ago that made me bitter at her. I'm like, okay, let's forgive her.

All right, great. You go for it. Jesus, I thank you for my mom. I just forgive her what she said and the way it made me feel. And I'm sorry for my response of bitterness and offense. That's not what the Bible says to do. And so I bless them today in Jesus' name. Thank you for my mom. I let her go from all that.

Does that make sense? Right? It says teaching them to obey. It doesn't mean you can't share revelation, you can't share what Jesus is saying. It's not like that. But it's just simple obedience. How do we obey Jesus? Okay? Awesome. Okay. So, the last part of this.

I want us to get into kind of like, I'm calling these like discipleship groups, just small groups. And I'm going to give us some questions to ask one another, to challenge one another, right? Because we want to be like this. And a lot of times discipleship, it's about actually asking good questions. Jesus asked really good questions.

And He was the best disciple the world's ever seen. And we see Him asking questions that draw people's heart out in a good way. Not in a weird, manipulative way, but just, oh, this is going to get to the heart of what I actually believe. This is going to get to the heart of why I don't actually obey God in this area of my life.
